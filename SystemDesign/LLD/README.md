# Low-Level Design

*The high-level design fixes the **what**, and the low-level design is all about the **hows***

Exhaustive component level design process of your application. It includes:

- Designing data structures
- Designing database
- Designing your classes and interfaces
- Designing algorithms
- Implementing various design patterns to ease development

## How to approach?

1. **Use Cases Generation**: Gather all the possible use cases
2. **Constraints and Analysis**: How many users, how much data etc.
3. **Basic Design**: Most basic design, few users case
4. **Bottlenecks**: Find the bottlenecks and solve them
5. **Scalability**: A large number of users

## LLD Document

It is a heavy-duty, bulky document that contains the pseudocode for the developers. The main objective is to mitigate any additional burden developers face during the development phase by clearly laying out details. It acts as a reference material for the developers.
